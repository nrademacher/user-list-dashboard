This is my solution to a coding challenge for junior to early mid-level frontend engineers.

The requirements were as follows:

- Fetch user data from a provided endpoint
- Store results in state with proper typing
- Display a set of data (user’s name, email, and company.name) in the app
- Use a clean, readable layout for rendering the data
- Allow users to search the user data by name
- Search results should update as the user types
- Searching should ideally be debounced to minimize API requests
